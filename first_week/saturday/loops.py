# exercise
# write a loop that counts from 1 to 100 (including) and
# prints all the multiples of 10, using a for loop and
# a while loop

# for loop solution
# for i in range(1, 101):
#     if i % 10 == 0:
#         print(i)

# print("----------------------------")

# counter = 1
# while counter <= 100:
#     if counter % 10 == 0:
#         print(counter)

    # counter += 1
